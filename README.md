# Deploying an ANN Model on ESP32-S3 WROOM-1 DevkitC-1
This repository outlines the process for deploying an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model on the ESP32-S3 WROOM-1 DevkitC-1, tailored for applications requiring real-time inference from inputs such as speed and torque to predict system efficiency.

## Overview
The deployment process encompasses converting a trained ANN model into TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) format, suitable for execution on low-resource devices. This includes optional quantization for model size reduction and steps for preparing the model for deployment on the ESP32-S3 platform.

## Model Architecture and Training
The model is a Sequential ANN trained to predict efficiency based on speed and torque inputs. The architecture consists of multiple dense layers, optimized for performance and accuracy.

## Conversion to TensorFlow Lite
The conversion process transforms the trained model into a more compact and efficient format, enabling its deployment on microcontrollers.

## Basic Conversion
A simple conversion to TFLite format is performed using TensorFlow's TFLiteConverter. This step is crucial for adapting the model to the constraints of embedded devices.

## Conversion with Quantization
For larger models, quantization reduces the size without significantly compromising accuracy, ensuring the model fits within the limited memory of the target device.

## Preparing for Deployment
Using XXD for Model Conversion
The TFLite model is converted into a C header file (.h) using the xxd utility. This file is then included in the Arduino project for deployment.

xxd -i converted_model.tflite > model_data.h

# Adjustments in the Header File
Modifications to the generated C header file may be necessary, such as defining the number of model inputs, outputs, and configuring memory requirements for TensorFlow Lite Micro operations.

# Deploying on ESP32-S3
Deployment involves loading the model onto the ESP32-S3 WROOM-1 DevkitC-1 using the Arduino IDE. Instructions are provided for setting up the development environment, including necessary libraries and board configurations.

# Input Data Format
The model expects input data in a specific format, typically as floating-point values representing speed and torque. Details on preparing and sending this data to the model for inference are included.

# Inference and Output
Upon deployment, the model predicts the efficiency of the system based on the provided inputs. The output is accessible via serial communication, demonstrating the model's real-time inference capability on the ESP32-S3.

# Prerequisites
TensorFlow installation for initial model training and conversion.
